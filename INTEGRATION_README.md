# Urban Mechanic - Frontend & Backend Integration

## 🎯 Overview

This project successfully integrates the enhanced frontend website with the Node.js/Express backend to create a complete Urban Mechanic platform where:

- **Customers** can find nearby mechanics and request help
- **Mechanics** receive real-time notifications when customers need assistance
- **Location-based matching** connects customers with nearby available mechanics

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (Enhanced Website)
- **Location**: Enhanced multi-page website from Downloads folder
- **Features**: 
  - Interactive map with Leaflet.js
  - Real-time location tracking
  - Service request forms
  - Mechanic finder with filtering
  - Responsive design

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **Database**: MongoDB with geospatial indexing
- **APIs**: RESTful endpoints for mechanics, service requests, and notifications
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system
- **Email**: Nodemailer for notifications

## 🔗 Integration Points

### 1. API Endpoints Created

#### Mechanics API
- `POST /api/v1/mechanics/nearby` - Find nearby mechanics by coordinates
- `GET /api/v1/mechanics/:id/notifications` - Get mechanic notifications

#### Service Requests API
- `POST /api/v1/service-requests/request-help` - Create service request and notify nearby mechanics
- `PUT /api/v1/service-requests/:id/accept` - Accept service request (for mechanics)

### 2. Frontend Integration

#### JavaScript API Client (`js/api-integration.js`)
- `UrbanMechanicAPI` class for all API calls
- `MechanicFinder` class for location-based searches
- `NotificationSystem` class for real-time notifications

#### Updated Pages
- **find-mechanic.html**: Now connects to real backend APIs
- **mechanic-dashboard.html**: Shows real-time notifications and service requests

## 🚀 How It Works

### Customer Flow
1. **Visit** `/find-mechanic` page
2. **Allow location access** to get current position
3. **View nearby mechanics** on map and in list
4. **Click "Request Help"** on any mechanic
5. **Fill service request form** with vehicle and problem details
6. **Submit request** - nearby mechanics get notified via email

### Mechanic Flow
1. **Register** as mechanic with location and services
2. **Set availability** to "Available" in dashboard
3. **Receive email notifications** when customers request help nearby
4. **View notifications** in dashboard with real-time polling
5. **Accept service requests** directly from dashboard
6. **Update status** and communicate with customers

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB running locally or MongoDB Atlas connection
- Email service configured (for notifications)

### Installation
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment**:
   Create `.env` file with:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/urban-mechanic
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   JWT_EXPIRE=30d
   EMAIL_FROM=noreply@urbanmechanic.com
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
   ```

3. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Test the integration**:
   ```bash
   node test-integration.js
   ```

## 🧪 Testing the Complete Flow

### 1. Create Test Data
Run the test script to create sample mechanics and customers:
```bash
node test-integration.js
```

### 2. Test Customer Experience
1. Visit: `http://localhost:5000/find-mechanic`
2. Allow location access
3. See nearby mechanics on map
4. Click "Request Help" on any mechanic
5. Fill out the service request form
6. Submit request

### 3. Test Mechanic Experience
1. Visit: `http://localhost:5000/mechanic-dashboard`
2. Login with test mechanic credentials
3. Set availability to "Available"
4. See real-time notifications for new requests
5. Accept service requests
